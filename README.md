# Python_Learning
Hi, This is Rigved Bansal 
In this Repository I am documenting my learning process in python as a self taught programmer
So far it has been awesome, Lets see what Python has in store for me along the way(23 - 08 - 2020)
Since I am coming from a JAVA background, OOP was quite easy to grasp
I have difficulties with the TIC TAC TOE projects
Its going great but its getting tougher :)
