# Python_Learning
Hi, This is Rigved Bansal 
In this Repository I am documenting my learning process in python as a self taught programmer
So far it has been awesome, Lets see what Python has in store for me along the way(23 - 08 - 2020)
Since I am coming from a JAVA background, OOP was quite easy to grasp
I have difficulties with the TIC TAC TOE projects
Its going great but its getting tougher :)
(28 - 08 - 2020)
So, I took a break for a few days
But today i finished my Milestone project 2 
a blackjack game
(08-09-2020)
So i didnt commit any changes or new files for a long time as I had exams
and i forgot to upload the new changes
so im about to finish my python course and im feeling pretty confident!!!!
i also learned many other modules such as InstaPy,wikipedia,youtube,folium and pyautogui
the next thing im going to learn is web development with flask
